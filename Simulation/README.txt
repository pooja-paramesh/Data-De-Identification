	Most publicly available activity datasets are small for various reasons such as unavailability of participants and need for data collection over long periods of time. However, evaluation of anonymization approaches typically requires large data sets to achieve desired levels of accuracy. To address this problem, a larger synthetic data set was generated from Student Life dataset (Wang et al., 2014).  The original dataset consists of activity sequences collected through a sensing application over a period of ten weeks from 49 students. It is available at (https://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/dataset.html)

Data for each student is a sequence of time-stamp and activity inference pairs.  Three types of activities are included: running (R), walking (W) and stationary (S).  The synthetic data is generated by using a Markov chain model in the R statistical environment. In the original data, activity inference is made every two seconds which results in very high dimensionality. This type of high dimensionality results in very large un-manageable state transition matrices. Moreover, the analyses of activity data are typically conducted at higher time levels such as daily and weekly. Therefore, for this study, each activity sequence is aggregated to the level of one-minute intervals, and the most dominant activity during an interval is assigned as the activity for that interval, resulting in 1,440 intervals a day. In addition to the three activities, unknown values are also present. An unknown value is represented as an activity as well, and it is referred to as missing (M). This is because an adversary can make inferences based on the unknown data. For example, if the adversary knows that the victim turns the device off during class hours, then, the data set will contain unknown values consistently during the class hours, and if there are only a few records with this routine, then, the identity of the student is at stake. A state transition matrix is constructed for every hour, for each student. The state transition matrices are used to simulate activity sequences for 720 hours (30 days) at minute-level granularity. A noise degree of 1% is added, i.e., at each hour, with a probability of 0.01, a different studentâ€™s state transition matrix is chosen at random for simulation.  

How to run?
################################################################
1. Use R version 3.5.1

2. Install markovchain library using install.packages("markovchain")

3. Clone the repository to your local machine and set the working directory to the Simulation folder using setwd(<path>)

4. Create an empty folder called SimUsers which will contain the result of the simulation 

5. Run Simulation_Test.R. Change the parameters if necessary. Default parameters simulate 50 users' data from the first 5 original users' data. Simulated data is at the minute-level granularity, for a length of 30 days.
